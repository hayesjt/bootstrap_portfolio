Same Portfolio is made using bootstrap

Detailed Discription:

I am making the same portfolio which can be found in my "portfolio" repo. Instead of manual CSS I 
have decided to use Bootstrap elements and minipulate them to get the look I want.

The Nav Bar, Media Section, button, and Footer code are all from getbootstrap.com.

The 3 pages you can view are:
1. About me
2. Portfilio
3. Contact

All forms on Contact page are not currently active and will not actually submit content. This project
is stritctly to edit the front end of a webpage.
